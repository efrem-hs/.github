### This organisation contains repositories I've worked on while being in high school at CNTLR (Colegiul Național "Traian Lalescu" Reșița) 2016-2020.
- My main profile can be viewed at [@dragosefrem](https://github.com/dragosefrem).

*Note: commits in the repositories presented are not dated back to the time I was in high school. That is because I haven't used Git nor GitHub back then. As such, these repositories 
should be treated as archives of my work from my high school days (2016-2020)*
